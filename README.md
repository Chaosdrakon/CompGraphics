How do I approach designing software?
//What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
//What design process did you follow for your project work?
//How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  The biggest thing that I learned in this project is how to get a full understanding of my project before actually starting the project. This viewpoint allowed me to see each section as its own and with proper commenting am able to add different sections correctly to the code as things are needed. When designing my project I would start of basic with creating one section and than confirm that it was working and than move on to the next one. by taking this section approach it allowed me to ensure everything was working correctly before adding more things to the code as a whole. THe tactics I learned I feel can be used in every project that I work on and throughout any SDLC that I have in class or in my career.

How do I approach developing programs?
//What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
//How did iteration factor into your development?
//How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I would say the biggest strategy I developed was proper commenting to ensure everything went where it was supposed to and to ensure if something was not working correctly when I ran the program I could trace it back to the correct section and correct it. Adding things throughout the entire course really made me plan my development out from the beginning and to ensure that everything was in its properly place instead of just tacked on to the end of the last code. I have developed more long terms ways to plan out coding instead of just putting it all together line after line. Even when working on the same sections like adding a cube or plane i would comment the sections in before starting the code to ensure it did not run into other lines of coding.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
//How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
//How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  This course as a whole as taught me many ways to handle larger projects in sections to make the overall project flow more effectively. This course also helps me in my career with breaking down larger jobs and projects into managable pieces and to ensure everything will have its proper place and work correctly when it is all put back together.
